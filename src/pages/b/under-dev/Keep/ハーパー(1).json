Does globalization have a positive effect on Japan or negative effect on Japan? How about Ami?\n\nami: I against with glovalization in Japan, because local people follow the foreign culture more, forgetting their own.With large number of people moving into and out of a conntry, so Japanese people foget their own culture. In Japan there are a lot of culture,such as Kimono, Sushi, and more, so we should protect our own culture. How about you Shuto Onoue?\n\nshuto : I am for the globalization in Japan. This is because having international ties with companies in other countries leads to productivity improvement. And international economic problems in Japan are also resolved by international operation and efforts. Moreover, by aiming for globalization, companies will be able to use various resources such as technology, knowledge, and human resources scattered around the world, and the skills and culture of companies will develop dramatically. That\u2019 all. How about (you), Mia?\n\nmia: I am against the globalization. Because as globalization progress, outflow of excellent engineer and some carpenter or teacher will outflow and progress. Especially in Japan, these days, wage fallen and excellent human resources tend to quit their jobs. So more progress globalization, more excellent people will go to foreign country. So, I am against globalization. How about Yoshihiro?\n\nyoshihiro: I believe that globalization has a positive influence on Japan for the following two reasons.\n\nFirst, globalization will promote Japanese people about their own culture. This is because, if Japanese people learn about foreign culture, Japanese people will realize our (their) own culture is good.\n\nSecondly,  if more foreign companies develop Japan, Japanese economy will be boosted.\n\nFor those reasons, I'm for globalization.\n\nami : OK thank you. I think globalization has put a serious burden on the eovironment, too, because \nin order to globalization, we may (to) broke many forests or trees, so many animals may be die. How about you, Yoshihiro.\n\nyoshihiro: Sorry, please say it again.\n\nmia: OK. I think globalization is bad to environment. (What) do you think about environment?\n\nyoshihiro: I think that environmental problems will also be solved by introducing knowledge and skills imported from foreign countries. For example, nuclear generation was not invited in Japan, but Japanese government used it until 2011. And nuculear power generation has a positive influence on environment because it doesn't emit carbon dioxide. So globalization also can improve envionment. So I believe that environmental problems can also be solved by globalization, too.\n\nami: OK\nI have some opinion. Of cause it is good for environment globalization, but I think globalization have a big problem about increasing foreign species animal. What do you think about this.\n\nshuto: I think so too, but if some countries protect the animal(s) together, they can use (advanced technology in each of those countries) and they can cooperate with (other countries for) the problem. (By doing so,) they can protect more, so countries should cooperate with each other.\n\nyoshihiro: I also think that problems of exotic species can be solved by government policies and companies' cooperation as Shuto said. I don't think that, because of that problem, globalization should be denied.\n\n\n\n","title":"ハーパー","userEditedTimestampUsec":1657058331611000,"createdTimestampUsec":1656212257800000,"textContentHtml":"<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:16.0pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">mia: Today let's talk about globalization.
